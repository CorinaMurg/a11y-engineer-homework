# Accessibility Engineer

## My Implementation (please scroll below for the requirements for this project)

### Questions

1. Does the `autocomplete` attribute on inputs help or hinder accessibility?

2. The UI does not show the alert generated on submission if a field has the `required`` attribute. 
- Is `required` off, or is the alert just hidden?
Note: the `required` has the benefit of bringing focus to the first input that has an error, but I was not
successful at hiding the error tooltip. ðŸ˜¡

3. I bundled all error messages under one `aria-live` element. 
- Should the focus be directed to the first input that has an error?

4. Should form validation include a check whether the full name field contains two words?

5. For the submit button's `hover` and `focus` states, I used a background color of dark gray.
- Is this a good alternative to using an `outline` when in focus?
Note: It was not clear from the UI whether `focus-visible` is preferred to `focus` that is why I used the latter.

6. Would a `skip link` make sense here?

7. I was confused by this requirement:
    Spacing values
    - 6px
    - 12px
    - 24px
    - 48px
- I assumed they refered to `letter-spacing`, but I was not sure what do do with such large values.
Note: I added my own `letter-spacing` values.


## PROJECT REQUIREMENTS FROM AD HOC
https://homework.adhoc.team/accessibility_engineer/

## Instructions & Guidelines

Please build a responsive HTML page from the attached large and small screen designs.

- Form does not have to submit anywhere
- Animations are not required
- Submissions should score a 100 in a Google lighthouse accessibility scan
- Please build for modern browsers, don't worry about polyfills and legacy support
- Task runners are not required, but use if youâ€™d like
- No UI libraries
- No JS libraries or frameworks
- No mixin libraries
- Please provide any needed build instructions

## Information

Below, you will find the technical information needed to complete the assignment. You do not have to use the specific pixels listed, translating to a relative unit is fine. Please add your solution into the `./src` directory.

The error depicted in the design is meant to communicate a state, so this should be built as validation on each form field.
